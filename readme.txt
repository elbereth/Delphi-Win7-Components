    Delphi for Windows: Windows 7 Component Library
========================================================================

Simply install the Component Package into your Delphi IDE and you are 
set to go. The Packages are in the corresponding folder. As there are no
component editors at the moment, this one package will serve as both -
design-time and run-time.

All Components are installed into the category "Windows 7 Support."

NOTE: You may use the components as-is, without any warranties supplied. 
Use them at your own risk.



If you plan to use this code for creating your own component libraries,
you must place them under GPL.

If you plan to use them in any of your applications, you are free to do
so without any further restrictions. I would be honoured if you refer
to me either in your application or in your documentation. For those 
cases, the components are given to you with any of the following license
systems: GPL, LPGL, or MPL.

            reordered, created or deleted after initialization.
